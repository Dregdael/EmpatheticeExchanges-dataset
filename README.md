This is a repository for article "EmpatheticExchanges: Towards Understanding the Cues for Empathy in Dyadic Conversations." in IEEE Access. 

THe main goal for this repository is the classification of empathy in textual exchanges using various classifiers. 

We provide the original dataset the code to replicate the work found on the paper. 

In addition, we provide access to an enhanced dataset that contains more conversations labeled with our empathy metric.
